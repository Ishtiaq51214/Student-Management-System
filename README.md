# Student-Management-System
I have created a Student Management System Project in C++. In this Project I have used four pillars of OOP i.e: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism and Abstraction. Moreover I have applied 
UML to illustrate the Project to find best possible relations between classes i.e: implementation of composition and association.
